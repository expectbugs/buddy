## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-26

### üß† Phase 1 Memory Improvements - Advanced Intelligence & Processing

This major release implements comprehensive memory system improvements based on extensive research of mem0 best practices and production implementations.

### Added

#### üéØ **Intelligent Memory Filtering**
- **Trivial Pattern Detection**: Automatically filters out greetings ("hi", "hello", "thanks"), small talk, and meaningless exchanges
- **Priority Threshold System**: Only stores memories with priority scores above 0.3 threshold
- **Content Length Validation**: Prevents storage of excessively short or incomplete information
- **Smart Classification**: Distinguishes between important facts and casual conversation

#### üìä **Comprehensive Fact Extraction**
- **Systematic Analysis**: New 5-category extraction framework:
  1. **Personal Facts**: Names, occupations, locations, demographics
  2. **Relationships**: Family, friends, professional connections with specific roles
  3. **Preferences & Opinions**: Likes/dislikes, favorites, attitudes with sentiment
  4. **Activities & Projects**: Jobs, hobbies, current activities with context
  5. **Factual Statements**: Technical details, specifications, commitments

extract_simple_facts(user_input) 

# After: Comprehensive systematic extraction
extract_memory_candidates(user_input, assistant_response)
‚Üí Analyzes 5 categories systematically
‚Üí Applies priority scoring (0.0-1.0)
‚Üí Filters trivial patterns automatically
‚Üí Handles complex relationship mapping
```

#### Background Processing Architecture
```python
# New asynchronous memory pipeline:
