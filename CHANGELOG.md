Fixed critical bug causing context expansion failures and verified system intelligence.

### Fixed
- **Context Expansion Bug**: Fixed `temp_lookup_code` ‚Üí `shared_lookup_code` variable error

- **Context Retrieval**: Expansion now successfully retrieves conversation context

### Verified
- **Intelligence Enhancement**: AI responses include specific details from expanded context
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive testing confirms expansion provides meaningful intelligence

## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-04

### üéØ Phase 2 Enhanced Memory & Official mem0 Compliance

Enhanced memory system with automatic context linking and restored official mem0 behavior.

### Added
- **EnhancedMemory Wrapper**: `enhanced_memory.py` with automatic context linking
- **Automatic Metadata**: All memories include timestamps, lookup codes, version tracking
- **System Tools**: `fresh_start.py` for database cleanup

### Fixed
- **mem0 Compliance**: Removed custom filtering that blocked important information
- **Information Loss**: Mixed content messages now properly processed
- **LLM Decision Making**: Restored mem0's official extraction behavior

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-04

### üöÄ Phase 1 Context System & Quality Improvements

Context expansion system and resolved inappropriate memory storage issues.

### Added
- **Context System**: `context_logger.py`, `context_bridge.py`, `temporal_utils.py`
- **Smart Filtering**: Prevents inappropriate content storage (commands, temporal data)
- **Full Context Logging**: Every conversation with unique lookup codes

### Fixed
- **Aggressive Extraction**: Fixed mem0 creating relationships from every fragment
- **Temporal Pollution**: Stopped current date/time being stored as memories
- **Database Cleanup**: Reset Neo4j/Qdrant for clean relationship building

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-03

### üéâ Production-Ready Memory System with mem0

Complete overhaul transitioning to industry-standard mem0 library.

### Added
- **mem0 Integration**: Official mem0ai v0.1.102 with Neo4j graph + Qdrant vector storage
- **Proper Deletion**: "forget X" actually deletes memories using mem0's delete() API
- **Deduplication**: Automatic detection and merging (85% threshold)
- **Entity Sanitization**: Clean extraction removing system IDs and special characters

### Fixed
- **Memory Forgetting**: Fixed - commands now delete instead of adding "wants to forget"
- **Boss Hierarchy**: "Josh's boss is Dave" ‚Üí "Dave manages Josh" relationship
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic deduplication prevents redundant storage

### Changed
